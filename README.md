# Gemini Music Studio 🎵 AI-Powered Composer

Gemini Music Studio is an advanced Single Page Application (SPA) that uses Google's Gemini AI to compose complex, multi-track music in real-time within your browser.

## Features ✨

*   **AI Composition**: Uses Gemini Pro to generate full song structures (melody, harmony, bass, drums) based on text prompts.
*   **Real-time Synthesis**: No MP3 files! The browser synthesizes audio in real-time using the Web Audio API (via Tone.js).
*   **Multi-Track Mixer**: Control volume and mute status for each instrument independently.
*   **Visualizer**: Live frequency spectrum visualization.
*   **Export**: Download your creations as `.webm` audio files.
*   **Cyberpunk UI**: A modern, dark-mode interface with neon accents.
*   **Secure**: API Keys are stored locally in your browser (LocalStorage) and never sent to our servers.

1.  **Get an API Key**: You need a Google Gemini API Key. Get one for free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Enter Key**: Click the settings icon or wait for the prompt, then paste your API key.
3.  **Describe Your Music**: Type a prompt like:
    > "An upbeat 80s synthwave track with a driving bassline, retro drums, and a dreamy melody."
    > "A dark orchestral piece with heavy drums and tense strings."
4.  **Generate**: Click "Create Music" and wait for the AI to compose.
5.  **Play & Mix**: Use the playback controls and the mixer below to adjust the sound.
6.  **Download**: Save your masterpiece!
